# WATSON SMS (WSMS)

Our team sought out to create an app that worked primarily via text messages. The purpose of the app is to boil down the personality traits for person by asking them a series of questions.

For example you would get two statements like these "I do not find it easy to introduce myself to other people." and
"I find it easy to introduce myself to other people.", and you would choose between the two which you identify with the most.

At the end we would compile this list of sentences and use IBM Watson to detect specific personalty traits of the user.

We used the Twilio API to make the SMS communication possible and MongoDB as our data store.
